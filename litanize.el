;;; Commentary:

;; A simple version of Ian Bogost's method of generating "Latour Litanies"
;; from random wikipedia titles as an exercise in ontography, metaphorism,
;; and carpentry
;;
;; Currently uses wikipedia titles as elements. Might be extended to use
;; other lists in other futures.
;;
;; 'M-x litanize' will generate a litany in a new buffer
;;
;; 'M-x litanize-at-point' will generate a litany at the point
;;
